    <h2 class="text-red-500 text-2xl font-bold p-3">Question 1:</h2>
    <p class="text-indigo-600 font-bold text-lg p-3">Difference between map,filter,forEach,find is given below :-</p>
    <div class="grid grid-cols-4 text-center">
        <h1 class="border-2 border-indigo-600 font-bold p-5"><span class="text-indigo-700 text-xl">map</span> <br><p class="py-4"> 1.map() calls a function once for each element in an array.<br>2.map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. <br>3.map() does not execute the function for empty elements.<br>4. map() does not change the original array.<br>5.map() method allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function</p></h1>
        <h1  class="border-2 border-indigo-600 font-bold p-5"><span class="text-indigo-700 text-xl">filter</span><br><p class="py-4">1.The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array.<br>2.The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.<br>3.The filter() method does not change the original array.<br>4.If you check out the output of the above example, the value of y is an array of 1 element that satisfies the condition. This is because the filter() method iterates over all elements of the array and then returns a filtered array which satisfy the condition specified.</p></h1>
        <h1  class="border-2 border-indigo-600  p-5 font-bold"><span class="text-indigo-700 text-xl">forEach</span><br><p class="py-4">1.The forEach() method is an iterative method.<br>2.The forEach method passes a callback function for each element of an array together with the following parameters:

           <br> Current Value (required) - The value of the current array element
            <br>Index (optional) - The current element's index number
            <br>Array (optional) - The array object to which the current element belongs</p></h1>
            <h1  class="border-2 border-indigo-600 p-5  font-bold"><span class="text-indigo-700 text-xl">find</span> <br> <p class="py-4">1. the find() method searches for first element in the array that satisfies the condition specified.<br>2.
            filter() returns an array containing the element that satisfies the condition, but find() returns the element itself that satisfies the condition.
           <br>3. In filter(), whole array is iterated despite the fact that the element being searched for is present at the beginning. But in find(), as soon as the element that satisfies the condition is found, it gets returned.</</p>h1>

    <p class="text-indigo-600 font-bold text-lg p-3">Difference between localstorage,session storage and cookie is given below :-</p>

               1. The localStorage mechanism provides a type of web storage object that lets we can store and retrieve data in the browser. <br>2.localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. <br>3.localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.<br>4.There is no transfer of data to the server.<br>5.There are fewer old browsers that support it.

                1.The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB <br>2.It’s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed<br>3.There is no transfer of data to the server<br>4.There is no transfer of data to the server.<br>5.There are fewer old browsers that support it<br>6.A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open.

                1.Cookies expire based on the setting and working per tab and window  <br>2.The storage capacity of Cookies is 4KB This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed<br>3.Both clients and servers can read and write the cookies<br>4.The term “cookie” refers to just the textual information about a website. In order to recognize us and show us results according to our preferences, this website saves some information in our local system when you visit a particular website. .<br>5.It is supported by all the browser including older browser

    <!-- question 3. -->
    <h2 class="text-red-500 text-2xl font-bold p-3">Question 3:</h2>
    <p class="text-indigo-600 font-bold text-lg p-3">how to work event loop is given below :-</p>
    <p class="text-lg font-bold px-5">eventloop:The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack.The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing.It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.</p>
