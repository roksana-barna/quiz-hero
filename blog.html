        <h1 class="border-2 border-indigo-600 font-bold p-5"><span class="text-indigo-700 text-xl">map</span> <br><p class="py-4"> 1.map() calls a function once for each element in an array.<br>2.map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. <br>3.map() does not execute the function for empty elements.<br>4. map() does not change the original array.<br>5.map() method allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function</p></h1>
        <h1  class="border-2 border-indigo-600 font-bold p-5"><span class="text-indigo-700 text-xl">filter</span><br><p class="py-4">1.The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array.<br>2.The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.<br>3.The filter() method does not change the original array.<br>4.If you check out the output of the above example, the value of y is an array of 1 element that satisfies the condition. This is because the filter() method iterates over all elements of the array and then returns a filtered array which satisfy the condition specified.</p></h1>
        <h1  class="border-2 border-indigo-600  p-5 font-bold"><span class="text-indigo-700 text-xl">forEach</span><br><p class="py-4">1.The forEach() method is an iterative method.<br>2.The forEach method passes a callback function for each element of an array together with the following parameters:

           <br> Current Value (required) - The value of the current array element
            <br>Index (optional) - The current element's index number
            <br>Array (optional) - The array object to which the current element belongs</p></h1>
            <h1  class="border-2 border-indigo-600 p-5  font-bold"><span class="text-indigo-700 text-xl">find</span> <br> <p class="py-4">1. the find() method searches for first element in the array that satisfies the condition specified.<br>2.
            filter() returns an array containing the element that satisfies the condition, but find() returns the element itself that satisfies the condition.
           <br>3. In filter(), whole array is iterated despite the fact that the element being searched for is present at the beginning. But in find(), as soon as the element that satisfies the condition is found, it gets returned.</</p>h1>
